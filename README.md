# GRYP Gloves — Landing (Vite + React + Tailwind)

## Quick start
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:5173

## Files to add
Place your 3D model at:
```
public/assets/gryp-glove.glb
```
An image poster is already included: `public/assets/gryp-poster.jpg` (you can replace it).

## Notes
- Uses <model-viewer> for true 360 viewing with hotspots.
- Logos are in `public/assets/gryplogo-mark.png` and `public/assets/gryplogo-wordmark.png`.
- Minimal UI components are in `src/components/ui/` so there is no external UI dependency.
